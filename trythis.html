<p><abstract> <strong>Summary</strong>: The Observation Game is a game that can be played anywhere in the world, at almost any time. All you need is a brain<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, and some creativity.</p>
<p></abstract></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-play">Why play?</h2>
<p>The purpose of this game is to practice making observations about ourselves that we often overlook. We don't often think too deeply about our day-to-day actions, because we do them every day. Instead of thinking about <em>what</em> the action the is, try to think about <em>why</em> the action was done in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h2>
<p>In order to get into this mindset, try this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Today, pretend that you are the detective in a comedy-mystery game.</li>
<li>Theme is Somewhere in between Sherlock Holmes, Scooby-Doo, and the Office.</li>
<li>You started playing this game, but didn't read the game instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, you remember watching some half-ass youtube preview of this game! Based on the preview, you are able to remember bits and pieces of the setting, and some of the tips and tricks. You quickly jot down some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are on a mission to save the world.... (or something)...</li>
<li>You're just going to wing it, and find out what you can.</li>
<li>There are clues and patterns everywhere.</li>
<li>There appears to be an underlying goal to this whole place.</li>
</ul>
<p>You quickly notice a bunch of humans bustling around. They all seem familiar, and they apparently know you. Some of them are rushing about, being busy with various actions. Others are relaxing; they are doing other things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Observe how the humans interact with each other (and with you).</li>
<li>How do the humans interact with objects or tools?</li>
<li>What do the humans seem to have problems with?</li>
<li>The humans seem to be making patterns without realizing it.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="actions-and-goals">Actions and Goals</h1>
<p>Try writing down these observations as you notice them. By &quot;write down&quot;, I mean &quot;twiddle thumbs at your phone until the text appears on the screen&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Tasks&quot; can be substituted for &quot;Actions&quot;, and you can make your own categories. These are just some humorous examples. The whole point is to think about the motivations behind these actions. Are they personal or altruist? Mix of both?</p>
<h2 id="possible-task-categories">Possible Task Categories</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Tasks that absolutely need to be done, eventually... by at least SOMEBODY.</p>
<ul>
<li>flushing the toilet.</li>
<li>unlocking the front door.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks that make you feel good when you do them.</p>
<ul>
<li>saying hi to people.</li>
<li>yelling at people. (some people just need to get their anger out).</li>
<li>wandering around from point A to point B. (maybe you enjoy the adventure more than point A or point B)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks that you find to be utterly pointless.</p>
<ul>
<li>Telling that person from #2, &quot;you should stop yelling.&quot;</li>
<li>Afterwords, all you can do is facepalm.</li>
<li>Spending an hour categorizing tasks, and writing ridiculous examples.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks that shouldn't even be problems... but... they are... they just are.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helping somebody figure out how to use the TV remote.</li>
<li>Cleaning up the mysterious poo that has suddenly appeared on the floor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks that NOBODY likes doing, but SOMEBODY has to do it...</p>
<ul>
<li>If you had the choice, you would make somebody else do it.</li>
<li>You are only doing it right now because you can't find anybody else to.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Tasks that you think belong in 1 category, but end up being in another.</p>
<ul>
<li>You THOUGHT it was pointless to walk in circles for an hour.</li>
<li>Turns out it's actually good exercise.</li>
<li>In fact, people go to the Olympics to show off how fast they can do circles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>You gather up you notes (ha! as if you wrote anything down). Now that you've collected some observations about humanity, you decide to make some conclusions about their motivations, goals, and their strange day-to-day actions.</p>
<p>(Note: Try to stick to within the setting, and avoid preconceptions from your other experiences of humanity you've had outside of this game.)</p>
<ul>
<li>In this group of humans, What is their mission?<br />
</li>
<li>What problems do they want to solve?</li>
</ul>
<p>Out of the problems you see, are there problems that....</p>
<ul>
<li>are not actually problems?</li>
<li>are often ignored?</li>
<li>are given too high of priority?</li>
<li>are given too low of priority?</li>
<li>people care about for irrational purposes?</li>
<li>you literally don't understand why it's even a problem.</li>
<li>have no good answer?</li>
</ul>

<p>The secret mission is to &quot;identify and define problems&quot;. Solving a problem is easier than organizing a problem in such a way that it becomes a solvable.</p>
